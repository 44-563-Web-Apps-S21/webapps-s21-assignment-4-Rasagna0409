            <h2>The Taming of the Shrew</h2>
            <h3>Act 3, Scene 1: Padua. BAPTISTA'S house </h3>
            <p class="stage-direction"> Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA</p>
                <h6 class="Name">LUCENTIO</h6>
                    <p class="Speech LUCENTIO">Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
                    Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
                    Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?</p>
                    <h6 class="Name">HORTENSIO</h6>
                    <p class="Speech HORTENSIO">But, wrangling pedant, this is
                    The patroness of heavenly harmony:
                    Then give me leave to have prerogative;
                    And when in music we have spent an hour,
                    Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.</p>
                    <h6 class="Name">LUCENTIO</h6>
                    <p class="Speech LUCENTIO">Preposterous ass, that never read so far
                    To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
                    Was it not to refresh the mind of man
                    After his studies or his usual pain?
                    Then give me leave to read philosophy,
                    And while I pause, serve in your harmony.</p>
                    <h6 class="Name">HORTENSIO</h6>
                    <p class="Speech HORTENSIO">Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.</p>
                    <h6 class="Name">BIANCA</h6>
                    <p class="Speech BIANCA">Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
                    To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
                    I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
                    I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
                    But learn my lessons as I please myself.
                    And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
                    Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
                    His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.</p>
                    <h6 class="Name">HORTENSIO</h6>
                    <p class="Speech HORTENSIO">You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?</p>
                    <h6 class="Name">LUCENTIO</h6>
                    <p class="Speech LUCENTIO">That will be never: tune your instrument.</p>
                    <h6 class="Name">BIANCA</h6>
                    <p class="Speech BIANCA">Where left we last?</p>
                    <h6 class="Name">LUCENTIO</h6>
                    <p class="Speech LUCENTIO">Here, madam:
                    'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
                    Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'</p>
