            <h2>The Taming of the Shrew</h2>
            <h3>Act 3, Scene 1: Padua. BAPTISTA'S house - Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA</h3>
                <p>LUCENTIO
                    Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
                    Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
                    Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
                    HORTENSIO
                    But, wrangling pedant, this is
                    The patroness of heavenly harmony:
                    Then give me leave to have prerogative;
                    And when in music we have spent an hour,
                    Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
                    LUCENTIO
                    Preposterous ass, that never read so far
                    To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
                    Was it not to refresh the mind of man
                    After his studies or his usual pain?
                    Then give me leave to read philosophy,
                    And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
                    HORTENSIO
                    Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
                    BIANCA
                    Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
                    To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
                    I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
                    I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
                    But learn my lessons as I please myself.
                    And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
                    Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
                    His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
                    HORTENSIO
                    You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
                    LUCENTIO
                    That will be never: tune your instrument.
                    BIANCA
                    Where left we last?
                    LUCENTIO
                    Here, madam:
                    'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
                    Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'</p>
